# Introduction

In this paper we want to gather data, describe it and lastly to predict footballers' transfer value by using a variety of methods from the field of data science.Naturally the paper is structured into three sections: Data gathering, data description using vizualization and moddeling. [^1] In the first section we briefly describe how we scraped the data from Transfermarkt.co.uk, Wikipedia.org and Google.com what type of data emerged and what ethical challenges we should consider.
In the second part the dataset is described using vizualization in order to get an overview of the data and the variables which affect the transfer values. In the final part, we use statistical learning models to predict the transfer values of footballers. The emphasis will be on testing different models and comparing their predictive power on a test set.

# Data Gathering

In order to do the analysis, we have to gather data. We gathered the relevant data from the website Transfermarkt.co.uk and Wikipedia.org. Transfermarkt.co.uk contains information on football transfers, player's information and statistics. We find all this kind of information highly relevant in order to predict the transfer value of a player.
We used Wikipedia.org in order to find data about the table rangings in the five leagues, which also was available on Transfermarkt.co.uk but we could not succeed in scraping it from the webpage.
The data was extracted by two web scrapers, one for Transfermarkt.co.uk and the other for Wikipedia.org. The two scrapers was biuld with the purpose of scraping the relevant data on both webpages. The scraper for Transfermarkt.co.uk ran through all transfers in the transfer windows "Summer 15" and "Winter 16" in the five biggest European leagues: Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1. It also ran through the transfered players' data. This means that we had two dataframes from Transfermarkt.co.uk at first, which then was merged into one dataframe consisting of players' data.
The scraper for Wikipedia.org ran through the different webpages with the ranging tables of the five leagues. At first we had 5 different dataframes, which we merged into one dataframe.
The two different datasets were at first cleaned and then merged into one big dataset containing only the variables we find relevant in predicting the transfer values of the players.
We do not consider any ethical issues scrapping this data, because all the information is publicly available and not private in any way.

## Data Cleaning

### Cleaning The Player Dataset
As written earlier before merging the different dataframes into one final, we had to clean both the dataframe with the player data and the dataframe with the club data. Cleaning the player data, we first had to make all unavailable data into NA in stead of different signs. We also had to clean the transfer date and put it into the right format, which we also did with the variable containing remaining time under contract. Some of the data scraped from Transfermarkt.co.uk had some mistakes, which we had to fix by putting them to be equal to NA.
We calculated the age of each player at the transferdate by first cleaning the birth date of the players and afterwards calculating the transferage in R by our selves.
At last we divided the players into three different categories: Defender, Midfield and Attacker because we found it more appropriate in order to do our analysis. If we did not divide the players into these categories, we would have a dataset with a lot of different type of players, which could be categorized as we did. This categorization means that it is possible to do a reasonable vizualizaton considering that we "only" have 12 pages to write our project.
We removed all duplicated observations, observations where transfer.fee was NA and the keepers. The reason for removing the keepers was because we scraped data on mostly offensive statistics, which obviously does not have an affect on the keepers' transfer values. Also the number of variables concerning the keepers' was different compared to the other three types of players, which meant that the observations did not fit into the right column for the keepers.

### Cleaning The Club Dataset

Cleaning the club dataset we started with grouping the different clubs in 3 categories: Top Club, Middle Club and Bottom Club. Afterwards we renamed the clubs, so they matched the player datasetm which meant that we could merge the player dataset and the club dataset by using leftjoin.
At last, before merging, we selected the variables that we found interesting and removed all other variables in our final cleaned club dataset.

## The Final Dataset

The clean and merged data set contains the following descibtive variables of the transfered players:

Variable Name | Describtion
------------- | -------------
name          | Name of player
nationality   | Nationality of player
birth_place   | Birth place of player
birth.date    | The date at which the player was born
transferage   | Age of player when transfer occured

The clean and merged data set contains the following statistial variables of players:

Variable Name         | Describtion
--------------------- | -------------
positions             | Position on field of player
total.goals           | Total amount of goals scored by player
penaltygoals          | Total amount of penalty goals scored by player
total.assists         | Total amount of assists made by player
substitutions_in      | Total amount of matches where player gets substituted into the match
substitutions_out     | Total amount of matches where player gets substituted out of the match
total.minutes.played  | Total amount of minutes played by player
minutes.pr.goal       | Amount of minutes played per goal scored by player
yellowcards           | Total amount of yellow cards the player got
secondyellow          | Total amount of second yellow cards the player got
redcards              | Total amount of red cards the player got
contract.left.month   | How many month left of the transfered players' contract when transfer occurs

All the statistics above are from the season before the transfer happend, which means the season 2014/2015.

The clean and merged data set contains the following descibtive variables of clubs and transfers:

Variable name | Describtion
------------- | -------------
club.to       | Which club player is transfered to
club.from     | Which club player is transfered from
league        | The league at which the buying club is playing
status        | Status of the buying club, which is divided in "Top Club", "Middle Club" and "Bottom Club"
transfer.date | Which date the transfer happened
transfer.fee  | The transfer fee in million of pounds


All the variables above, we think, are relevant in order to make the best prediction possible of a players transfer value.
